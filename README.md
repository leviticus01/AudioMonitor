List of files and their descriptions:

AudioDemo.asm - SCOMP software for the demonstration (same as AudioDemo.mif)
AudioDemo.mif - memory initialization file for the demonstration (same as AudioDemo.asm)

AudioMonitor.vhd - the peripheral

SCOMP.sof - could be useful for programming the DE-10 without doing a full compilation

SCOMP_Project_Spr23.zip - if no further changes are made to the project, this is the actual file to turn in on canvas
